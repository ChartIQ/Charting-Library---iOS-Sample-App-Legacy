# Charting-Library---iOS-Sample-App-Legacy

This is a basic iOS application built with ChartIQ's iOS charting SDK. Both the native SDK and this application are intended to provide guidance on how to implement a native iOS app that interacts with the most common API calls in the [ChartIQ JavaScript library](https://documentation.chartiq.com).

**End of support**

Support for this app and the [Charting-Library---iOS-SDK-Legacy](https://github.com/ChartIQ/Charting-Library---iOS-SDK-Legacy) project ended as of Version 8.0.0 of the ChartIQ library. Please see the app in the [ChartIQ-iOS-SDK](https://github.com/ChartIQ/ChartIQ-iOS-SDK) instead.

## Requirements

Version 7.0.5 to 7.5.0 of the ChartIQ library.

## Getting started

See the [Getting Started on Mobile: iOS - Legacy](https://documentation.chartiq.com/tutorial-Starting%20on%20iOS%20-%20Legacy.html) tutorial for instructions on compiling the application and using the native SDK.

Open the application in Xcode using the *xcworkspace* file and build.

**Note:** The application currently targets an older version of Swift than Xcode prefers. The application will compile, but if you would like to update the Swift target, you must use Xcode's converter.
